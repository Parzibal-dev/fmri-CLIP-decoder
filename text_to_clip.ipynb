    "Over the last 15 years, there has been an exponentially compounding effort of interpreting the 'Meaning' of language by machines. With the astronomical rise of LLMs, fueled by the giant leap of improvement in attention mechanisms, understanding how meaning of input is parsed and understood is the by far most researched topic in the Data Science world, and particularly in the NLP world. With pre-training, we can achieve an effect of \"understanding\" a language, and the patterns in it, for later downstream task (as demonstrated by the rise of GPT models). We have seen that with enough compute power and electricity, we can practically teach machines to understand *anything*, from photos to videos to audio, and transformers have already made a huge impact on the world, less than a decade after being concieved.\n",

In the dataset supplied by the original Pereira paper, there are 6-7 photos for each concept, all of them describing the concept (in contrast to the text which only has one related embedding vectore - the name of the concept). Because we're working with the high-end model of CLIP, embedding takes quite a bit of time. Moreover, the because the input is the same each time, the output embedding vector is also equal for each individual photo. For those reasons, we chose to separate the embedding itself from the main pipeline, and use it as a baseline. The strategy, though, was to embed and save every single picture for every single concept. This was done because when dealing with multiple inputs, it begs the question of what is the best way to process them for later evaluation. <br>\n",
    "Specifically, the possible we checked for processing our base image embeddings are:\n",
    "1. Mean - the \"intuitive\" way to approach multiple inputs per concept, this is just taking all of the embedding vectors, and averaging each of their components to create one \"centralized\" one.\n",
    "2. Medoid - It's a similar way of getting one clustered value from a batch of values, but it differs slightly. Medoid is the data point whose average distance to all other points is smallest.\n",
    "3. Best of K - This is a third way to look at the data, based on the first two. We'll still calculate the average or the medoid for each concept, but instead of clustering ALL of our data for each concept, we'll the the k best ones. For example, a Best of 3 mean approach would mean we'd take the 3 \"best\" image-based embedding vectors of the concept, and take their mean as our final embedding vector. The definition of \"Best\" here would be \"Cosine Similarity to the embedding of the single text-based embedding vector of the same concept\". The choice of cosine similarity to define closeness is extensively discussed further down the notebook."

If our hypothesis is correct, then a linear decoder will be able to capture the meaning of the images in the same embedding space, without adding any non-linearity - a simple model should suffice, as much as is did for the same modality data. <br>\n",

Pereira is still the only open English dataset for fMRI cross-modality, single concept data, similar to what we're trying to model. There are some other alternatives - Allen 672 which is Chinese, Tuckute 2024, which is for full sentences only, six words each, each of them on no more than 16 participants. That means we were little available data to train on. Because of that fact, we'll choose to evaluate the data using K-Fold Cross Validation - that way, we can train on every piece of data we have, and still evaluate the model. The folding strategy would be as follows - we're going to train a set of 18 decoders, each trained on 170 concepts, and evaluated on the remaining 10 only.

    "**fit_decoder** - This function is a small wrapper to the `learn_decoder` function that from the Pereira paper. The point of the wrapper is to:\n",
    "1. Be able to switch out `learn_decoder` for any other fitting function or pipeline - if we wanted to try and fit using elasticnet instead of ridge, or even add non-linearity, for further testing of hypotheses, like trying to optimize for the best voxel mask size, instead of the original 5000 (all of these won't be a part of our analysis, but still, we find that allowing further possible research is an essential part of the research process, as almost all research is built on top of previous research).\n",
    "2. Masking indexes - according to the Pereira paper, if we're masking our training data, we need to mask the same indexes on our test data. This could be done without a function, but saving the masking as a built in part of the process prevents later errors.\n",
    "3. Scaling - We're also scaling our data after training, to standardize the data around the mean 0 and with standard deviation of 1. This helps us to create a robust scale for any application of usage of our embedding features, whether PCA, linear regression, or a full-blown nueral network."
